# Spring Wordle #

### Summary ###
This project is a barebones clone of the game Wordle built with Spring Boot. The main purpose of this project was for me to get experience with how Spring Boot works along with how a web application is built.

### Installing/Running ###
Clone this repo:
`git clone https://github.com/Marcusk19/springwordle.git`
`cd springwordle`
Then you can build and run the project using gradle:
`gradle build`
`java -jar build/libs/spring_wordle-1.1.jar`
Navigate to localhost and you should see the application.
